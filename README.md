# Research Project Template

This repository provides a reproducible and structured template for empirical research projects.
It is designed to be cloned for each new paper or research project.

The template supports:
- Pre-study documentation (pre-analysis plans / preregistration)
- Reproducible data analysis in R
- Seamless integration with LaTeX / Overleaf
- Optional integration with OSF

---

## 1. How this template is intended to be used

### One repository = one research project

For each new paper or research project:
1. Clone or use this repository as a template
2. Rename the repository to the project name
3. Work only inside the cloned project folder

GitHub is the **source of truth**.
Overleaf and OSF are used as interfaces, not as primary storage.

## 3. Typical workflow (example)

### Example: New empirical paper

#### Step 1: Create a new project
- Use this repository as a template
- Rename the repository (e.g. `energy-feedback-rct`)
- Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio

#### Step 2: (Optional) Pre-study / preregistration
- Fill in the files in `prestudy/paper/`
- Adjust power simulations in `prestudy/R/`
- Compile the pre-study document in Overleaf
- If required, copy the content into OSF for preregistration

If no preregistration is required, this folder can remain unchanged.

#### Step 3: Data analysis
- Place raw data in `data/raw/` (never edited)
- Implement data loading in `R/01_load_data.R`
- Run the full pipeline via:

```r
source("masterfile.R")
