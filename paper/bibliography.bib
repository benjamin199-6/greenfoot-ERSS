  abstract = {Significance                            With three billion people subsisting on the equivalent of \$2.50 per day, alleviating poverty is one of the most urgent challenges facing the world today. One solution to this problem has been to encourage the growth of small enterprises through microlending. A successful innovation is represented by               Kiva.org               , which matches citizen lenders with low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries. To increase prosocial lending, we use a large-scale field experiment and machine-learning methods to recommend lending teams to lenders. We find that lenders who join a team contribute significantly more compared with those who do not. Our results suggest team recommendation can be an effective and low-cost behavioral mechanism to increase charitable contributions.                        ,              This paper reports the results of a large-scale field experiment designed to test the hypothesis that group membership can increase participation and prosocial lending for an online crowdlending community, Kiva. The experiment uses variations on a simple email manipulation to encourage Kiva members to join a lending team, testing which types of team recommendation emails are most likely to get members to join teams as well as the subsequent impact on lending. We find that emails do increase the likelihood that a lender joins a team, and that joining a team increases lending in a short window (1 wk) following our intervention. The impact on lending is large relative to median lender lifetime loans. We also find that lenders are more likely to join teams recommended based on location similarity rather than team status. Our results suggest team recommendation can be an effective behavioral mechanism to increase prosocial lending.},

  abstract = {Social commerce (s-commerce) is a rapidly developing form of e-commerce powered by social media influencers (SMIs). It can create valuable opportunities for retailers. In light of this growing trend, this study explores the influence of consumers’ engagement experiences (social support and presence) on community identification and consumers’ attachment to SMIs, along with their impact on consumers’ stickiness in the s-commerce context. We explore this through social presence and social support theory. The survey data from 411 s-commerce users via an online questionnaire were analyzed empirically with the PLS-SEM approach. The results indicated that presence and social support have significantly positive impacts on consumers’ attachment to SMIs and community identification, respectively. This increases users’ stickiness in s-commerce. This study enriches our understanding of user stickiness in s-commerce and can assist online vendors in developing marketing strategies and cultivating sustained relationships with their users.},

  abstract = {Current social challenges have increased the interest in globally spread collective actions, especially those taking place in virtual space. Crowdfunding is one form of online activism that has recently gained importance. Although research conducted so far indicates the significance of social motives among participants of crowdfunding campaigns, knowledge about the psychosocial mechanisms involved in its effectiveness is limited. This article attempts to reinforce the position of crowdfunding as one of the forms of collective action and to expand knowledge about possible psychosocial factors that could shape participation in crowdfunding campaigns. In three pre-registered studies ( N = 823), we found that the social identity based on a shared worldview positively correlated with the intention to participate in prosocial crowdfunding. Moreover, the relationship between opinion-based group identity and collective action varied depending on participation type (predicted vs. experienced engagement in a campaign). In other words, when people gather in communities built around shared opinions on a given social issue, they develop a sense of community, which can translate into activities for the benefit of the group such as supporting crowdfunding campaigns. However, in the case of actual behaviour, unlike with the declaration of participation, the strength of the relationship with social identity significantly diminishes. The results are discussed in relation to the theory of collective action.},

  abstract = {It is of paramount importance to gain an understanding of pro-environmental behavior if we are to successfully tackle the climate crisis. The existing body of research provides evidence that identity influences pro-environmental behavior. However, such research is often over-generalised and researchers are challenged to conduct robust analyses with regard to specific local, cultural and educational factors. The present study aims to investigate whether personal or social identity has a distinct effect on three different dimensions of pro-environmental behavior, using the principles of self-categorisation theory. Additionally, the study seeks to determine whether one of these two factors, the individual or the social factor, is predominant over the other. The study group consisted of cooperative students in Germany, typically a group with high professional ambitions. The data was collected in a cross-sectional survey with a total of 568 cooperative students from academic disciplines in engineering and economics. The reliability of the scales is satisfactory (ω\,=\,0.76–0.88), and the hypotheses are tested by estimating structural equation models. Our research demonstrates that while social identity exerts a stronger influence on activist behavior than personal identity, personal identity has a more pronounced effect on consumer behavior than social identity. Nevertheless, no general statement can be made regarding the relative strength of the effects of personal and social identity on pro-environmental behavior dimensions.},
