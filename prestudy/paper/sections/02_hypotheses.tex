We pre-register the following hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H1:} Individuals exposed to the treatment exhibit a higher value of the primary outcome variable compared to individuals in the control group.
    \item \textbf{H2:} The treatment effect is heterogeneous and differs across predefined subgroups.
\end{itemize}

All hypotheses are directional unless stated otherwise.
